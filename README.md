# On the Run
Your character is in the "On the Run" marathon. An endless runner with obstacles
and abilities.


So the player is in these mega-ultra marathon races. Each run can be different
(or not), and if they die they are DQ'd. Then the next race has some made up
city name. This would only be interesting if it were proc. gend. I don't know
what I meant by that.


## Backlog

- buffered jump
- double jump
- coyote jump
- ragdoll physics
- track score
    * decide if time based or distance based is better
- proper third person camera


## Complete
